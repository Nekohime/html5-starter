# html5-starter

Very basic HTML boilerplate.  
No prefixes, proprietary elements and tags, or other extra fluff.  
Ordered using the "Outside In" method, with an extra rule: properties are alphabetically sorted.

```
Layout Properties (position, float, clear, display)
Box Model Properties (width, height, margin, padding)
Visual Properties (color, background, border, box-shadow)
Typography Properties (font-size, font-family, text-align, text-transform)
Misc Properties (cursor, overflow, z-index)
```
